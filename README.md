# Database Practical Assignment

This project contains a practical assignment for working with PostgreSQL databases.

## Task Description

Create a database named `firm` and a table called `employees` with the following fields:

- `id` — unique employee identifier
- `first_name` — employee's first name
- `last_name` — employee's last name
- `position` — job title
- `department` — department name
- `salary` — salary amount

## SQL Queries to Implement

1. Retrieve a list of all employees, showing their first and last names.
2. Find all employees who work in the IT department.
3. Retrieve the first and last names of employees with the position 'Manager'.
4. Retrieve the first and last names of employees with a salary equal to 40000.
5. Retrieve a list of employees with salary greater than 60000, including their first name, last name, and position.
6. Show the names of employees who work in the Marketing department and earn less than 20000.
7. Show a list of employee IDs (`id`) whose salary is between 30000 and 50000.

## Result

The project includes:

- A file with all SQL queries (`queries.sql`)
- Screenshots of the results of each query
- This `README.md` file

## Tools Used

- PostgreSQL 17
- Beekeeper Studio
